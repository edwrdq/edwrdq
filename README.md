## About Me

  I love reading books on finances and business principles, such as - [The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership: Follow Them and People Will Follow You](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400236169/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which I really recommend! 

  Outside tech, I love working with electricity itself and 3D printing.
